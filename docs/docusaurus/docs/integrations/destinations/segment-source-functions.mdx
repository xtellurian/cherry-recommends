# Segment Source Functions

Segment Source Functions are the primary method for delivering recommendations to connected Segment accounts.

[Read more about Segment Source Functions](https://segment.com/docs/connections/functions/source-functions/)

:::note Creating a connection

- For a recommendation destination to be valid, it must be associated with an existing Segment connection.

:::

## Creating a Segment Source Function Destination

In the recommender options menu, click on `Destinations`.

Next, choose which `Segment Integrated System` you wish to associate the destination with.
Finally, in the `Endpoint` field, enter the HTTP/HTTPS location of the webhook URL.
This webhook will be called every time the recommender is [invoked](/docs/recommenders/Deploy_Recommender/Invoke/invoke-items-recommender).

## Configure the Segment code

In [Segment](https://app.segment.com/), you'll need to write some Javascript to transform the incoming recommendation.
The sample below produces a [Segment TRACK event](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) with the top recommended item. 

```js
/**
 * Handle incoming HTTP request
 *
 * @param  {FunctionRequest} request
 * @param  {FunctionSettings} settings
 */
async function onRequest(request, settings) {
  const body = request.json();
  // See https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/
  Segment.track({
    event: "Recommendation Produced",
    // assumes the commonUserId is the same userId as Segment userId
    userId: body.trackedUser.commonId,
    properties: {
      recommendedItem: body.scoredItems[0].itemCommonId,
    },
  });
}
```
