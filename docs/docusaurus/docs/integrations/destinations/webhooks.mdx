Next, choose which `Custom Integrated System` you wish to associate the destination with.
Finally, in the `Endpoint` field, enter the HTTP/HTTPS location of the webhook destination.
This webhook will be called every time the recommender is [invoked](/docs/concepts/invokation).

## Security

All webhooks contain a signature validating that Four2 sent the webhook.
The validation method is similar to Hubspot's `X-HubSpot-Signature` method.

The `X-Four2-Signature` header contains an important value.
Your should independantly calculate the signature, and compare the value to this header.

To calculate the signature value:

1. Append the Request Body to the `Application Secret` of the associated `Custom Integrated System.`
1. Take the SHA256 hash of that value.
1. Convert the hashed value to a lowercase hexadecimal string.

Do not expose your Application Secret
