# Getting started with Segment

Four2 connects to Segment using the [Segment Webhook destination](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/webhooks/).

## Adding a webhook endpoint


In Four2, click the `Settings cog` in the main menu, and then click `Integrations`. 
Create a new integrated system, and choose Segment as the system type.
Give the integration a recognisable name, e.g. "My Company's Production Segment"

Once created, you'll see an overview page of the connection. 
Click `Create a Webhook` and then `Create Webhook Reciever`.
This sets up an endpoint, with details you can copy into Segment.

> [Your Segment integration will not work until you create a Segment Webhook destination](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/webhooks/).

Try sending a test event from Segment to confirm the connection.
