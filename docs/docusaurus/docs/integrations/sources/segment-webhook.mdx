# Consuming Segment webhooks

## Adding a webhook endpoint


Once you've [connected to Segment](../connections/segment) created, you'll see an overview page of the connection. 
Click `Create a Webhook` and then `Create Webhook Reciever`.
This sets up an endpoint, with details you can copy into Segment.

> [Your Segment integration will not work until you create a Segment Webhook destination](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/webhooks/).

Try sending a test event from Segment to confirm the connection.
