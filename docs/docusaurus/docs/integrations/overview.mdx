# Integrations

Four2 integrates with other systems. 
There are two types of connection: 
- A connection to a web service like Segment or Hubspot
- A custom connection, e.g. your own web service.

## Conceptual Model

Systems external to Four2 are called `Integrated Systems`.
They are connected to Four2 via `Connections`.
Connections handle the authentication.
Most integrated systems can be a `Source` of data about customers,
and/ or a `Destination` for recommendations.
