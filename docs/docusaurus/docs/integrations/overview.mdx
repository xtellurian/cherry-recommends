# Integrations

Cherry Recommends integrates with other systems. 
There are two types of connection: 
- A connection to a web service like Segment or Hubspot
- A custom connection, e.g. your own web service.

## Conceptual Model

Systems external to Cherry Recommends are called `Integrated Systems`.
They are connected to Cherry Recommends via `Connections`.
Connections handle the authentication.
Most integrated systems can be a `Source` of data about customers,
and/ or a `Destination` for recommendations.


## Data Sources

Sources provide data about customers. Cherry works with both event data streams (e.g. Segment) and summary data (e.g. Hubspot)



## Recommendation Destinations

Cherry Recommends can automatically push recommendations to connected Integrated Systems

:::note Creating a connection

- For a recommendation destination to be valid, it must be associated with an existing Integrated System.
