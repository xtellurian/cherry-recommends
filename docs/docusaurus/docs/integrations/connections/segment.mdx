# Getting started with Segment

Four2 connects to Segment using the [Segment Webhook destination](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/webhooks/).

## Creating a connection to Segment

In Four2, click the `Settings cog` in the main menu, and then click `Integrations`. 
Create a new integrated system, and choose Segment as the system type.
Give the integration a recognisable name, e.g. "My Company's Production Segment"

Next, you should [add a segment webhook destination](../sources/segment-webhook)
