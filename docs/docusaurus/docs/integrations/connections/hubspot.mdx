# Getting started with Hubspot

Four2 connects to Hubspot using the [Hubspot Marketplace](https://app.hubspot.com/ecosystem/20210647/marketplace/apps). 

> Four2 is currently unlisted, so you cannot discover it through Hubspot, but it can still be installed.

## Installing the Four2 app

In Four2, click the `Settings cog` in the main menu, and then click `Integrations`. 
Create a new integrated system, and choose Hubspot as the system type.
Give the hubspot integration a recognisable name, e.g. "My Company's Production Hubspot"

Once created, you'll see an overview page of the Hubspot connection. 
Click the `Connect to Hubspot` button to start the Hubspot application installation process. 
You'll be asked to login to Hubspot.

> Make sure the user making the connection has permission to read and write Hubspot Contact information.
