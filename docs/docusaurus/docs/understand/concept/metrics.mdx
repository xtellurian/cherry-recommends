## What is a Metric

A `Metric` is a named, derived property of a Customer.
Metrics are calculated from the stream of events in Cherry.
Commonly used Metrics include:
* Lifetime Revenue
* Account Status

## Creating a Metric

Navigate to `https://[yourtenant].cherry.ai/metrics` and click `Create Metric` in the top-right of the screen. 

You should see a screen like this.
![Create Metric](/img/screenshots/understand/create_feature.png)
Add in the name and the id for the Metric and your done. 

:::note Restrictions

Metrics are created globally within an environment. 
Metric values are calculated *per customer*. (i.e. a Customer Metric)

:::

Metrics are currently automatically computed from your Segment event stream and discussions with you.
For example, when you create a Lifetime Revenue Metric, the value is calculated for each customer.

## Feature Generators 
Feature generators are used to trigger a property that will provide you with an aggregate or 
sum of the feature count against each target user. 

For a step-by-step guide on how to set up a generator follow the docs on setting up [total revenue metric](/docs/understand/guide/total_revenue_metric)
