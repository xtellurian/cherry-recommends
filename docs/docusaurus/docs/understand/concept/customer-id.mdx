:::note
CustomerId was previously known as Common User Id
:::

The Customer Id is a special class of [Common Id](./common-id).

Cherry Recommends can track unique user behaviour across multiple systems. 
For this to work, a single *common* identifier is required to link customers on each integrated system.

> Cherry Recommends enforces unique common ids.

Cherry also maintains an internal id for each `Customer`.

## Considerations when choosing a Customer Id

When using Cherry, you must choose how to identify each of your customers.
Examples of identifiers include:

- The database primary key of each customer
- The email address of each customer
- The hashed (i.e. obfuscated) email address of each customer
- Your CRM's unique customer id

### Uniqueness

Customer Ids must be unique.
When choosing a Customer Id, you must ensure that each customer's common id is unique.
Any duplicate Customer Ids will be merged into a single `Customer`

### Availability

The customer's id must be available across your systems. 
When you invoke a Cherry `Recommender`, the Customer Id must be provided to identify the customer for whom to make a recommendation.
