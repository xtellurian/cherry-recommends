# Explore and Exploit

Cherry's artificial intelligence (AI) uses reinforcement learning to increase your revenue. 
Essentially, it tests `Items` out and allocates more customers to `Items` with higher benefit . 

Behind the scenes the AI balances two modes, Explore and Exploit.

## Explore 

In this mode, the AI is allocating `Items` to customers to maximise _knowledge_. 
It is allocating a significant amount of customers to new and novel `Items` to determine 
if customers will take them up, and if so, what is the revenue uplift.

## Exploit

In this mode, the AI is allocating `Items` to customers to maximise _value_. 
It is allocating most customers to `Items` that deliver most revenue to you.

## Explore then exploit

Cherry's AI allocates a mix of traffic to both Explore and Exploit.

Upon deployment, the AI is primarily focused on learning.
It then utilises this learning to allocate more and more traffice to the most valuable offers (e.g. Exploit).

This allocation maximises the revenue uplift 1-3 months after starting.

## It's a balance

As seen in the picture above, the AI doesn't allocate 100% of customers to either Explore or Exploit. 
When the system is starting, it's important to allocate some traffic to `Items`  you know have significant value (e.g. the pre-AI control).

After the AI has learnt a lot and knows which `Items`  are best, it still keeps a small amount of traffic on Explore.
Any changes or drifts in customer behaviour are then picked up quickly and adjusted to.
