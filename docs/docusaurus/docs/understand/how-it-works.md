# How Cherry Works

Cherry utilises the latest advances in artificial intelligence to personalize products and promotions for customers. 
It knows what a customer wants, and what is the best thing to give them to achieve a business goal (e.g. retain)

* Identifies what customers want next by understanding their behaviour
* Determines the best offer to give them next
* Provides the offer in an automated way for you to deliver
* Measures all outcomes to learn, grow, and increase business value

## Understand 

Cherry reads and interprets your customers attributes and past behaviours, and learns their wants, needs and drivers.
It understands incoming events and customer properties and builds a comprehensive profile of the customer.
Unlike other products, Cherry doesn't require lots of data integration and configuration to do this.

## Personalise

Cherry personalises offers on a set of Metrics that you identify or automatically does it with our AI.
Essentially Cherry chooses the best offer from a list for each customer to achieve some business outcome (e.g. convert, retain).
This personalisation doesn't require end-to-end bespoke reimagining of customer journeys.

## Serve

Cherry delivers recommendations directly through your website or through other avenues using Segment.
Recommendations can be delivered when customer behaviour changes or pulled to your website when a customer visits a page (e.g. checkout, cancel subscription).

## Grow

Using reinforcement learning, Cherry analyses past results and self improves over time for optimal conversion and outcomes.
Week-by-week, Cherry looks at how each offer is performing with each customer and updates its personalisation engine accordingly.
This means you get consistently better and better performances over time.
