Features enable the AI to understand customer behaviour and personalize the offers for them.

## What is a Feature

A `Feature` is a named, derived property of a Customer.
Features are calculated from a stream of behavioural events.
Commonly used features include:
* Lifetime Revenue
* Account Status

## Creating a feature

Navigate to `https://[yourtenant].cherry.ai/features` and click `Create Feature` in the top-right of the screen. 

You should see a screen like this.
![Create Feature](/img/screenshots/understand/create_feature.png)
Add in the name and the id for the feature and your done. 

:::note Restrictions

Features are created globally within your tenant. 
Feature values are calculated *per customer*.

:::

Features are currently automatically computed from your Segment event stream and discussions with you.
For example, when you create a Lifetime Revenue feature, the value is calculated for each customer.

## Feature Generators 
Feature generators are used to trigger a property that will provide you with an aggregate or 
sum of the feature count against each target user. 

For a step-by-step guide on how to set up a generator follow the docs on setting up [total revenue feature](/docs/understand/Guides/total_revenue_feature)
