# Features

A `Feature` is a named, derived property of a Customer.
Features are calculated from a stream of behavioural events.
Commonly used features include:
* Lifetime Revenue
* Account Status

Features are created globally within your tenant.
Feature values are calculated *per customer*

For example, when you create a Lifetime Revenue feature, the value is calculated for each customer.
