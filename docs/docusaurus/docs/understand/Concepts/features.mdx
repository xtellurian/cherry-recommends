Features enable the AI to understand customer behaviour and personalize the offers for them.

## What is a Feature

A `Feature` is a named, derived property of a Customer.
Features are calculated from a stream of behavioural events.
Commonly used features include:
* Lifetime Revenue
* Account Status

## Creating a feature

Navigate to `https://[yourtenant].cherry.ai/features` and click `Create Feature` in the top-right of the screen. 

You should see a screen like this.
![Create Feature](/img/screenshots/understand/create_feature.png)
Add in the name and the id for the feature and your done. 

:::note Restrictions

Features are created globally within your tenant. 
Feature values are calculated *per customer*.

:::

Features are currently automatically computed from your Segment event stream and discussions with you.
We will be releasing a Feature Generator which will enable you to define how Features are defined shortly.
