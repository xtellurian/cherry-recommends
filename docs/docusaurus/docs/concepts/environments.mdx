# Environments

Some Four2 resources can be organised into `Environments`.
Environments are a global resource, and their purpose is only to group other resources.
All tenants start with the 'default' environment.
Environments enable you to separate different Customers, Tracked Users, Items, Parameters, and Recommenders into groups.
A common use of environments is to create a development and production environment.

:::note Deleting environments

When you delete an environment, by default, all resources in that environment are transferred to the default environment.

## How environment selection works

Functionally, environment selection is done using the `x-environment` header.
The value of the header _must_ be an integer and the internal id of the environment you wish to select.
Not setting the `x-environment` header will select to the default environment.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="js">

```js
const signalbox = require("signalbox.js");

// set the default Id for all future calls.
// this injects the header `x-environment: 1` into all requests
signalbox.environments.setDefaultEnvironmentId(1);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Limitations

### Maximum number of environments

We currently restrict each tenant to have a maximum of 3 environments.
