# Common User Id

The Common User Id is a special class of [Common Id](./common-id).

Four2 can track unique user behaviour across multiple systems. 
For this to work, a single *common* identifier is required to link customers on each integrated system.

> Four2 enforces unique common ids.

Four2 also maintains an internal id for each `Tracked User`.

## Considerations when choosing a common user Id

When using Four2, you must choose how to identify each of your customers.
Examples of identifiers include:

- The database primary key of each customer
- The email address of each customer
- The hashed (i.e. obfuscated) email address of each customer
- Your CRM's unique customer id

### Uniqueness

Common user ids must be unique.
When choosing a common user id, you must ensure that each customer's common id is unique.
Any duplicate common user ids will be merged into a single `Tracked User`

### Availability

The customer's id must be available across your systems. 
When you invoke a Four2 `Recommender`, the common user id must be provided to identify the customer for whom to make a recommendation.
