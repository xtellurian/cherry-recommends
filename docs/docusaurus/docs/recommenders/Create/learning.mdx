### These tell the AI what to personalise on

Recommenders discover the best item or parameter for each customer.
To do this, they must be told how to segment customers into similar groups.
These segments are created using [Features](../concepts/features).

:::note Limitation
There is currently a limit of 2 learning Features per recommender.
This limit can be increased upon request.

## Choosing Learning Features

When choosing Learning Features, you should consider the following

### Potential Predictive Power

Does the Feature potentially give Cherry a hint for the best recommendation?
For example, if you're recommending marketing campaign products, then `Most Recent Purchase` is probably a good feauture to choose.

### Variability

Are Feature values likely to change across customers recieving recommendations?
For example, if you're recommending plans to brand new customers,
then `Lifetime Value` is not a good learning feature, as it will be zero for all users (i.e. no variability)
