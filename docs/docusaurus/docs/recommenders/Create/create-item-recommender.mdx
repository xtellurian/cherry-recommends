## Choosing a name

Recommenders have a name that helps you recognise it.
For example, if you're going to be recommending discounts to loyal customers,
then you could name your recommender "Loyalty Rewarder"

## Choosing an Id

The Id of your recommender must be unique, and you can use this Id to integrate with your recommender.

## Selecting Items

Item recommenders can select from a predefined set of items. For example, if this is a discount recommender,
then you should select all appropriate discounts to include in the recommender. This prevents unwanted
recommendations from being displayed.

> Selecting zero items implies that any item may be recommended.

### Choose the number of items to recommend

Though they default to 1 item, item recommenders may provide multiple items in a single recommendation. 
You can set the number of items from 1-9, depending on your use case. You can use the 'score' field to rank
the item recommendations when the recommender is invoked.

## Choosing a default or baseline item

It's important to set a reasonable default or baseline item. As the recommender begins to learn the preferences of tracked users,
the default item will be shown often. For reporting purposes, other items will be compared to the baseline for performance.
