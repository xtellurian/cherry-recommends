# Create an Item Recommender

To create an item recommender, click on the `Recommenders` menu, click `Items`, and then click the `Create` button.

## Choosing a name

Recommenders have a name that helps you recognise it.
For example, if you're going to be recommending discounts to loyal customers,
then you could name your recommender "Loyalty Rewarder"

## Choosing an Id

The Id of your recommender must be unique, and you can use this Id to integrate with your recommender.

## Selecting Items

Item recommenders can select from a predefined set of items. For example, if this is a discount recommender,
then you should select all appropriate discounts to include in the recommender. This prevents unwanted
recommendations from being displayed.

> Selecting zero items implies that any item may be recommended.

## Choosing a default or baseline item

It's important to set a reasonable default or baseline item. As the recommender begins to learn the preferences of tracked users,
the default item will be shown often. For reporting purposes, other items will be compared to the baseline for performance.
