## This will only invoke a recommender when a User Feature changes

Recommenders can be automatically invoked based on various triggers.
The `Features Changed trigger` will invoke the recommender when the chosen Feature(s) value changes for a specific customer.

### Example

Let's assume we have crated a Total Revenue Feature. i.e. we're calculating the total revenue for each Customer,
and storing that value in a Feature.

To calculate the total revenue for each Customer, we've created a Feature Generator job that runs every week.
Now, every time the Feature generator runs (weekly), Customers with new payments will have increased their total revenue.
When the new Total Revenue Feature value is calculated for a Customer, 
the linked Recommender will be invoked, and the recommendation will be sent to any connected destinations.

The following scenario describes a common setup:

1. Alice is a GetCoffee Customer.
1. GetCoffee has created an Item Recommender to find the best loyalty reward for Customers.
1. GetCoffee sets up a `Features Changed` trigger based on the `Total Revenue` feature.
1. Alice buys 2 coffees this week.
1. At the end of the week, because Alice's total revenue has increased, and her Feature value is updated.
1. The loyalty reward recommender is triggered, producing a new loyalty reward recommendation for Alice.
1. GetCoffee has a [webhook destination](../../integrations/destinations/webhooks) that automatically receives the new recommendation.
