title: Consume Recommendations

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";


By default, new recommenders are configured to track recommendations from every [invokation](/docs/recommenders/deploy-recommenders/invoke/invoke-items-recommender).
In some situations however, you may wish to preload a recommendation, and only track the recommendation when shown to the Customer.

:::caution Configuration Required

Your recommender must be set to require consumption events for this learning behaviour to be enforced.
This can be toggled in the recommender's `Settings` options.

:::

These situations may include:

- Preloading a recommendation in a browser application to minimise latency
- Preloading a recommendation into a custom CRM, but not necessarily acting on the recommendation.

### Generate a recommendation consumption event

<Tabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="js">

> Helpder syntax events.createRecommendationConsumedEventAsync() was introduced in version 1.4.5

```js
import { events } from "cherry.ai";
const ACCESS_TOKEN = "your access token";

// the recommendation comes from invoking the recommender
events
  .createRecommendationConsumedEventAsync({
    token: ACCESS_TOKEN,
    commonUserId: recommendation.commonUserId,
    correlatorId: recommendation.correlatorId,
  })
  .then(console.log) // log information about the response.
  .catch((error) => alert("Server responsed with an error"));
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
